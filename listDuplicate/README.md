You have a list of N integers between 1 and N-1. You know then there's at least 1 duplicated number in the list, but there might be more. For example: [1, 4, 8, 2, 10, 8, 4].

You need to find and print out at least 1 number that is duplicated in the list. In above example, you will need print out 8, or 4 (you don't have to print all of them).
