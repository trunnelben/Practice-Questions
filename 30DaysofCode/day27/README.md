Objective 
This challenge is very different from the others we've completed because it requires you to generate a valid test case for a problem instead of solving the problem. There is no input to read, you simply have to generate and print test values for the problem that satisfy both the problem's Input Format and the criteria laid out in the Task section. Check out the Tutorial tab for an instructional video on testing!
