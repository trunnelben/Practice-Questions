Today, we're discussing a simple sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
Given an array, , of size  containing distinct elements , sort array  in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following  lines:

 
where  is the number of swaps that took place.
 
where  is the first element in the sorted array.
 
where  is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.
