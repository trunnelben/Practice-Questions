The absolute difference between two integers,  and , is written as . The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, , is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in .

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array () for storing  non-negative integers, and a public integer () for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task 
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the  instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any  numbers in  and stores it in the  instance variable.
